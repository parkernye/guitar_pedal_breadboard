Prototype Board for Guitar Pedals


I wanted a simple PCB that I could place two breadboards on to help prototype my guitar pedals. 
It features multiple supply voltages, an input and output jack, and spots to plug in potentiometers of different values. 
Inspiration taken from the PedalPCB protoboard.

Future Modifications
- Swap DC jack polarity to match guitar pedal standards
- Add 'stereo' capabilities
